# Create a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python
A Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python is a computer program that implements the classic two-player board game Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with each player taking turns marking spaces in the grid with their own symbol, either X or O. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

To create a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, you will need to:

* Create a representation of the game board. This can be done using a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row on the board.
* Implement a function to display the game board to the console.
* Implement a function to allow players to make their moves. This can be done by prompting the player for a row and column number, and then updating the game board accordingly.
* Implement a function to check if the game is over. This can be done by checking for a winner or a tie.
* Implement a function to declare the winner of the game.
